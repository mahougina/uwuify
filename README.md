# uwuify
uwuify is a website that utilizes a RESTful service that will translate your input text into an uwu-ified message.

## what is uwu?
uwu, in terms of "language," is when text is in the form of a cutesy, somewhat incoherent way.
The following rules were applied in order to "translate" a message to uwu:

1) every l → w
2) every r → w
3) every o → owo
4) every u → uwu

These changes are applied to the input text and outputs your uwu-ified message!
